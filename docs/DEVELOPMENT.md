## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Go standard formatting
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

### Git Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make focused, atomic commits
3. Write clear commit messages
4. Create PR with description
5. Get review before merging

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Document all exported functions
- Keep examples up to date
- Write user guides for new features
